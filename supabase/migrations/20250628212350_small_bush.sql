  # Fix profiles table RLS policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing conflicting policies on profiles table
    - Create simplified and working RLS policies
    - Ensure authenticated users can read their own profile
    - Ensure admins can manage all profiles
    - Ensure service role has full access

  2. Changes
    - Remove complex policies that reference user metadata
    - Add straightforward policies based on user ID matching
    - Maintain admin access through role-based checks
